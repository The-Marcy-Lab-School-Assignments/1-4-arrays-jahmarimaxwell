# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
The parameter "nameToChange" is never read because it is supposed to be what the function changeName takes in as a parameter. Outside the function, it console logs the variable 'name' instead of console logging 'nameToChange'.


# Teacher Feedback
favoriteLocations was changed because arrays pass references that can be mutated, while name was not changed because it's an immutable string.
